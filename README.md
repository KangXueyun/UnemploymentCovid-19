# The impact of covid-19 on the Australian job market
> In this report, we focus on relationship between the changes in the employment market and covid-19 in Australia. To achieve this, we preprocess the employment data and covid-19 data from the government. We conduct the experiment on the preprocessed data and find the there is no significant correlation between the unemployment data and the number of positive covid-19. Although it is contrary to our intuition, we infer that this is because we didnâ€™t have enough data and there are too many factors not taken into account. We will accommodate more data and do more detailed analysis in the future.
